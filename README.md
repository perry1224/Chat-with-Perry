# Chat With Perry

## Description

The aim of this project is to clone chatGPT using OpenAI's API and test out the library of knowledge it has to offer and allow users to assist themselves in their daily lives or just ask curious questions.

## Purpose of this App

To further develop my React and JavaScript abilities as well as exploring the future opportunities AI has to bring 


### Key Features
* Users simply ask the AI a question and it will give a prompt reply after pressing the arrow key
* Users can start a new chat if they like by pressing the +New Chat button on the sidebar to save conversations

### Technology Used

* React
* Node.js
* Express
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaSCript



### What challenges did I face, what did I learn?
* Learned how to hide the API KEY without uploading it for public access for security reasons
* The importance of keeping Node up to date. It was not fetching properly and promises were not being carried out
